## Bid Requests
### These are the tasks we need assigned.  The VLs have evaluated whether they can perform these tasks 
###  and provided some options

Tasks:
   # IdentifyTarget
   - name: IdTarget_1
     # Hint for the scoring/constraints, higher priority tasks will give higher scores when assets are assigned earlier
     # Higher priority is a lower number, priority 1 is higher priority than 2, etc.

# Constraints
## Function to determine value of a combination of asset/resource
# API Function
## Could add in timeliness (difference between earliest start time and desired start time)

scoreFunction: utility = goalAchievement + ((5 - opportunityCost) * 20) + timeliness

## score(Map<Asset, Play>) :- weighted sum value
##   Asset: String ID (DDX1 or UAV1A)
##   Play: Play name (CruiseMissileStrike_3 or WideAreaPhoto_1) plus the start time and end time, e.g.
###         CruiseMissileStrike_3(1:3) (start at time 1, end at time 3)
###         IdentifyTarget_1(1:2)
## These scores come from the VL scoring algorithms that have scored each play individually

## e.g. score(UAV1A:IdentifyTarget_1(2:4), DDX:CruiseMissileStrike_SEAD(1:3), Fighter1:StrikeTarget_1_SEAD(4:5), ...) = 75
